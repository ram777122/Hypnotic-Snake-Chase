Hypnotic Snake Chase

Overview

Hypnotic Snake Chase is a game in Python written in Pygame. In the game, a snake follows the movement of your cursor, trying to "eat" the food that spawns in at random. Each time the snake consumes the food, it grows in length, thereby making it harder to steer around its path without touching something and causing a collision.

Features

Smooth Movement: The snake will smoothly follow the cursor position.

Dynamic Colors: The snake body parts are of random color and rotate for a hypnotically visual effect.

Endless Game: The game doesn't end; it goes on as the snake grows in length with increased consumption of food.

Gameplay Instructions

Move your cursor around the screen to guide the snake.

Gobble up the white circular food pieces by maneuvering the snake's head over them.

Avoid running off-screen (no boundary collision, for now).

Keep the snake moving and grow it as long as possible!

Controls

Mouse Movement: Sets the direction where the snake moves toward.

Quit: Close the window of the game to quit.
